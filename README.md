# SmartCents

## About the Project
SmartCents is a financial education web app built for **Recess Hacks 5.0**. It is designed to help adolescents learn about personal finance in an interactive and supportive way. The platform combines simple budgeting tools, savings goal tracking, and an AI-powered mentor to provide personalized advice.  

## Inspiration
We noticed that financial literacy is rarely taught at a young age, yet it is one of the most important life skills. Our goal was to create a tool that makes budgeting approachable, encourages saving habits, and gives students personalized tips to become financially independent.  

## What We Learned
- How to integrate AI into a web application for personalized mentorship.  
- Building both a frontend and backend under time constraints.  
- Managing application state between local storage and live updates.  
- Simplifying design for younger audiences while keeping features powerful.  

## How We Built It
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express  
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI API for personalized financial advice and chatbot functionality  
- **Data Management:** Local storage (no database required for this version)  
- **Deployment:** Hosted on Vercel for seamless frontend + backend delivery  

## Challenges We Faced
- Using **Live Share** for team collaboration since some members were not familiar with Git workflows.  
- Learning **Next.js** in under 10 hours to explore modern frameworks, while balancing hackathon deadlines.  
- Integrating AI responses into the frontend in a way that felt natural and useful to the user.  

## Features
- Dashboard with spending and saving insights.  
- Add and track transactions.  
- Set and monitor financial goals.  
- Independence Score to gamify progress.  
- AI Mentor and Chatbot that provide real-time financial advice.
